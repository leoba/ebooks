Scripts for generating html files (which can then be loaded into Calibre to create ebooks) from OPenn and The Digital Walters.

This repository contains two files: ebook-generation-OPenn.xsl and ebook-generation-Walters.xsl. These files generate simple HTML files, pulling descriptive metadata from the TEI manuscript descriptions (against which they are processed) and creating a list of images in the manuscript. 

These HTML files could be used on their own to provide a kind of simple online display. I loaded them into Calibre (http://calibre-ebook.com/), a software for generating ebooks. After I loaded them into Calibre, language and tags had to be added by hand (students helped with that part of the work, for which I am grateful). I generated epub files optimized for use in iBook, on the iPad, but Calibre supports other ebook formats and can optimize ebooks for various hardware and operating systems.

Happy bookmaking!
